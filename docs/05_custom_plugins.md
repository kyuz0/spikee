# Creating Custom Plugins

Plugins are Python scripts that transform payloads during dataset generation (`spikee generate`). They are used to create variations of your test cases *before* testing begins.

Sample plugins can be found within the `workspace/plugins/` directory, created by running `spikee init`. Further information about built-in plugins and usage examples can be found in **[Built-in datasets and plugins](01_builtin_datasets_and_plugins.md)**.

### Plugins vs. Dynamic Attacks: What's the Difference?

Both Plugins and Dynamic Attacks can generate variations of a payload, but they serve different purposes in the testing workflow:

*   **Plugins (Pre-Test Transformation):**
    *   **When they run:** During `spikee generate`.
    *   **What they do:** Create multiple variations of a payload. Each variation is saved as a **separate, independent entry** in the final dataset file.
    *   **Result:** When you run `spikee test`, every single variation generated by the plugin is tested against the target. This is useful for systematically evaluating a target's resilience to a known set of transformations (e.g., "Is the target vulnerable to Base64 encoding? To Leetspeak?").

*   **Dynamic Attacks (Real-Time Transformation):**
    *   **When they run:** During `spikee test`, but *only if* the initial, standard prompt fails.
    *   **What they do:** Generate and test variations one by one in real-time. The attack stops as soon as a variation succeeds.
    *   **Result:** Only the first successful variation (or the final failed attempt) is logged. This is useful for efficiently finding *any* successful bypass, rather than testing every possible variation.

In short, use **Plugins** to build a comprehensive dataset of known transformations. Use **Dynamic Attacks** to find a single successful bypass with adaptive, real-time logic.

## Plugin Structure

Every plugin is a Python module located in the `plugins/` directory of your workspace. Spikee identifies plugins by their filename.

### Plugin Template
```python
from spikee.templates.plugin import Plugin
from typing import List, Union

class SamplePlugin(Plugin):
    def get_available_option_values(self) -> List[str]:
        """Returns a list of supported option values, first is default. None if no options."""
        return None

    def transform(
        self, 
        text: str, 
        exclude_patterns: List[str] = None,
    ) -> Union[str, List[str]]:
        """Transforms the input text according to the user-defined logic, returning one or more variations.

        Args:
            text (str): The input prompt to transform.
            exclude_patterns (List[str], optional): Regex patterns for substrings to preserve.

        Returns:
            str: The transformed text in uppercase.
        """
        # Your implementation here...
```

### The `transform` Function

This is the core function of every plugin. It receives a payload string and returns one or more transformed versions.

#### Parameters
*   `text: str`: 
    The input payload, which is typically a combination of a jailbreak and a malicious instruction.

*   `exclude_patterns: List[str]`:
    A list of regular expression patterns. Your plugin **must not** transform any part of the `text` that matches one of these patterns. This is critical for preserving sensitive parts of a prompt, like URLs or specific keywords.

*   `plugin_option: str` **(Optional)**:
    A string passed from the command line via `--plugin-options` (e.g., `"my_plugin:mode=full;variants=10"`). If your plugin doesn't need configuration, you can omit this parameter.

#### Return Values
*   `str`: Return a single transformed string. Spikee will create one new test case from this.
*   `List[str]`: Return a list of transformed strings. Spikee will create a separate test case for **each string in the list**, allowing you to test multiple variations at once.

### Signature with Options Support
For more advanced plugins, you can accept a configuration string and advertise the available options.
```python
from typing import List, Union

def get_available_option_values() -> List[str]:
    """Returns a list of supported option strings for this plugin."""
    return ["mode=strict", "mode=full"] # "mode=strict" is the default

def transform(text: str, exclude_patterns: List[str] = None, plugin_option: str = None) -> Union[str, List[str]]:
    """Transforms the payload based on the provided option."""
    # Your transformation logic here...
```

## Supporting Target Options
For more advanced plugins, you can support `plugin_options` by implementing the `get_available_option_values` function. By default, it should return `None`, indicating no options are supported.

```python
from spikee.templates.plugin import Plugin
from typing import List, Union

class SamplePlugin(Plugin):
    def get_available_option_values(self) -> List[str]:
        """Returns a list of supported option values, first is default. None if no options."""
        return ["mode=strict", "mode=full"] # "mode=strict" is the default

    def transform(
        self, 
        text: str, 
        exclude_patterns: List[str] = None,
        plugin_option: str = None,
    ) -> Union[str, List[str]]:
        # Your implementation here...
```

## Handling Exclude Patterns
Correctly handling `exclude_patterns` is the most important part of writing a robust plugin. You must leave the excluded parts of the string completely untouched. The recommended way to do this is with `re.split`.

```python
# Example transformation function converting all text to uppercase with exclude_patterns support
import re

def transform(self, text: str, exclude_patterns: List[str] = None) -> str:
    if not exclude_patterns:
        # No exclusions, transform the whole text
        return apply_transformation(text)

    # 1. Create a single regex pattern that captures any of the exclude patterns.
    # The parentheses around the pattern are crucial for re.split to keep the delimiters.
    combined_pattern = "(" + "|".join(exclude_patterns) + ")"
    
    # 2. Split the text by the combined pattern.
    # even-indexed chunks are normal text; odd-indexed chunks are the exclusions.
    chunks = re.split(combined_pattern, text)
    
    # 3. Transform only the non-excluded chunks.
    transformed_chunks = []
    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # This is normal text, apply the transformation
            transformed_chunks.append(apply_transformation(chunk))
        else:
            # This is an excluded part, keep it as is
            transformed_chunks.append(chunk)
            
    # 4. Rejoin the chunks into a single string.
    return "".join(transformed_chunks)

def apply_transformation(text: str) -> str:
    return text.upper()
```
