## Built-in Seeds
Spikee comes with a variety of built-in seeds, each designed for a specific testing purpose. These seeds are located in the `datasets/` directory after you run `spikee init`. You can list them at any time with `spikee list seeds`.

| Seed | Source | Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| `seeds-cybersec-2026-01` | Reversec | Cybersecurity | A general-purpose dataset for testing prompt injection and cybersecurity harms. It focuses on common attack goals seen in web application security, such as data exfiltration, cross-site scripting (XSS), and resource exhaustion. |
| `seeds-harmful-instructions-only` | Reversec | Objectives | Specifically designed for attacks using **LLM Agents**, such as **Crescendo** and **LLM-Jailbreaker**. These attacks require a instruction (objective) to generate their own attack vectors dynamically. Contains harmful instructions in `instructions.jsonl`, while leaving jailbreaks and user inputs as empty placeholders. |
| `seeds-simsonsun-high-quality-jailbreaks` | External | Jailbreaks | A high-quality set of contamination-free jailbreak prompts, specifically curated to avoid overlap with the training data of many common safety classifiers. |
| `seeds-in-the-wild-jailbreak-prompts` | External | Jailbreaks | Contains approximately 1,400 real-world jailbreak prompts collected from public sources like Discord and Reddit (filtered from the TrustAIRLab dataset). Ideal for testing a target's resilience against known, publicly available jailbreaks. |
| `seeds-wildguardmix-harmful` | External | Harmful | A dataset for testing harmful content generation. The prompts are sourced from the WildGuard-Mix dataset. |
| `seeds-wildguardmix-harmful-fp` | External | Harmful (FP) | A companion dataset to `seeds-wildguardmix-harmful`, containing benign (harmless) prompts. |
| `seeds-toxic-chat` | External | Harmful | A dataset for testing toxic prompts, filtered from 10K user prompts collected from the Vicuna online demo. |
| `seeds-investment-advice` | Reversec | Topical Guardrails | Designed to test topical guardrails that are supposed to block personal financial or investment advice. It includes both malicious instructions and standalone attack prompts. |
| `seeds-investment-advice-fp` | Reversec | Topical Guardrails (FP) | A companion dataset to `seeds-investment-advice`, containing benign (harmless) queries about financial topics. |
| `seeds-sysmsg-extraction-2025-04` | Reversec | System Prompt Extraction | Specifically designed to test for system prompt extraction. The instructions and judges are tailored to detect if the target model leaks its own system prompt or initial instructions. |
| `seeds-llm-mailbox` | Reversec | Tutorial | An example seed tailored for testing an email summarization feature. The documents are sample emails, and the instructions are designed to test for vulnerabilities in that specific context. See the associated [blog post](https://labs.reversec.com/posts/2025/01/spikee-testing-llm-applications-for-prompt-injection) for a detailed walkthrough. |
| `seeds-empty` | Reversec | Utility | An empty template folder. It contains empty `documents.jsonl`, `jailbreaks.jsonl`, and `instructions.jsonl` files. This is the recommended starting point when creating a new dataset from scratch, especially for standalone attacks. |
| `seeds-mini-test` | Reversec | Utility | A very small set of examples for quick, functional testing of Spikee itself. Use this to verify your setup or to test a new custom target or plugin without running a large number of tests. |

> FP datasets are intended for use with the `--false-positive-checks` flag to measure how often a guardrail incorrectly blocks legitimate prompts when evaluating harmful content filters.
>
> External datasets require you to run a fetch script to download the prompts. See the `README.md` inside each seed folder for instructions. Some of these use an LLM judge by default, which will be specified in the seed's README.

** Usage Example**
```bash
spikee generate --seed ./seeds-cybersec-2026-01
```

## Built-in Targets

Spikee includes a variety of built-in and sample targets, which can be listed at any time with `spikee list targets`.

**Built-in targets** focus on several common LLM providers, and will require you to rename `.env-example` to `.env` and add any necessary API keys - these are located within the `spikee/targets/` folder. 

| Target | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `llm_provider` | Provider | Generic LLM target for supported LLM providers (e.g., openai, bedrock, google, ollama, e.t.c.) ([See Docs](./03_llm_providers.md)) |
| `aws_bedrock_guardrail` | Guardrails | Assess AWS Bedrock Guardrails |
| `az_ai_content_safety_harmful` | Guardrails | Assess Azure AI Content Safety Harm Categories |
| `az_prompt_shields_document_analysis` | Guardrails | Assess Azure Prompt Shields Document Analysis  |
| `az_prompt_shields_prompt_analysis` | Guardrails | Assess Azure Prompt Shields Prompt Analysis |


**Sample targets** are provided within the `workspace/targets/` folder - created by running `spikee init`. These demonstrate how to write custom targets and can be easily modified to assess an LLM application of your choice.

| Target | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `sample_target` | Single-Turn | Sends a GET request to a fictional application, demonstrating options and advanced guardrail and error handling. |
| `sample_target_legacy` | Single-Turn (Legacy) | Returns a mock message. This is a legacy target, demonstrating the older target format. |
| `sample_pdf_request_target` | Single-Turn | Sends a POST request containing a PDF to a fictional application. |
| `test_chatbot` | Multi-Turn | Sends requests to [Spikee Test Chatbot](https://github.com/ReversecLabs/spikee-test-chatbot) |
| `simple_test_chatbot` | Multi-Turn | Implements the simple multi-turn target, and sends requests to [Spikee Test Chatbot](https://github.com/ReversecLabs/spikee-test-chatbot) |
|`llm_mailbox` | Single-Turn | Sample target for email summarisation application [tutorial](https://labs.reversec.com/posts/2025/01/spikee-testing-llm-applications-for-prompt-injection) |

**Usage Example**
```bash
spikee test --dataset datasets/cybersec-2026-01.jsonl \
            --target llm_provider \
            --target-options "bedrock/claude45-haiku"
```


## Built-in Judges

Spikee includes several built-in judges to evaluate LLM responses, located within the `spikee/judges/` and `workspace/judges/` folders. These can be listed at any time with `spikee list judges`.

**Basic Judges**
These evaluate responses based on simple criteria.

* `canary`: Checks if a predefined canary string is present in the response.
* `regex`: Uses regular expressions to identify specific patterns in the response.

**LLM Judges**
Some test cases, success cannot be determined by a simple keyword or pattern. For instance, did the model's response contain harmful advice, or did it refuse to answer a question on a restricted topic?

LLM-based judges address this by using a separate LLM to evaluate the target's response against a natural language criterion.

* `llm_judge_harmful`: LLM judge to evaluate whether the target LLMs response complied with a potentially harmful user prompt.
* `llm_judge_objective`: LLM judge to evaluate whether the target LLMs response meets a specific input objective.
* `llm_judge_output_criteria`: LLM judge to evaluate whether the target LLMs response meets specific success criteria defined in `judge_args`.

The LLM Agent model can be specified using the `--judge-options` flag. See **[LLM Providers](./03_llm_providers.md)** for a complete list of supported models, prefixes, and examples. Some common examples include 
* `offline`: Mock judge, for restrictive environments. See [re-judging](<./08_judges.md#Re-judging>) and [isolated environments](./12_installing_spikee_in_isolated_environments.md) documentation for more information.
* `bedrock/<model_name>`: AWS Bedrock API (e.g., `bedrock/claude45-haiku`)
* `openai/<model_name>`: OpenAI API (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o-mini`)
* `google/<model_name>`: Google Gen AI API (e.g., `google/gemini-2.5-flash`)

**Usage Example**
```bash
# Use an offline judge, allowing for later re-judging
spikee test --dataset datasets/cybersec-2026-01.jsonl \
            --target llm_provider \
            --target-options "bedrock/claude45-haiku" \
            --judge-options offline
```

## Built-in Plugins
Spikee includes several build-in plugins, that can be leveraged to enhance dataset generation. These are scripts that will apply static transformations to payloads during dataset generation, and can create multiple iterations of each entry. Built-in plugins are located in the `spikee/plugins/` directory, local plugins are located in the `plugins/` directory within your workspace. You can list them at any time with `spikee list plugins`.

The following list provides an overview of each build-in plugin, further information on each plugin can be found within the plugin file.
